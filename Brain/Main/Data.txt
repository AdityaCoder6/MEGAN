I belong to a place where the students are in the mob mentality of getting good marks, rather than being appreciated for their extravagent skills, they are scolded for scoring poor marks in their exams which hinders them in boosting up their personality. But on the contrary, I find myself on a crossroad (like Robert Frost had two ways in the poem "The Road Not Taken") of either improving my personality and skills or intensifying my studies for good marks in exams. Within these complexities, I want to take you on a journey of a typical day in my life and a day I dream of. So, my typical day begin at the crack of dawn with the alarm clock being blarred at 5am, that pulls me from the depths of sleep. It drags me to get out of my bed and get determined to make the most of my day. From 5 to 7am, I dedicatedly study. Then I head towards my school where all of my time is usually engaged with classes, homework, and socializing with my friends. However, the sigh of relief in all this is playing volleyball with great enthusiasm. Afterwards, I return to my home and head to my family's small stationery shop, helping out for about 3 to 4 hours each evening. After returning home, I hit the books once more for 3 to 4 hours to excel up my academic skills. After completing all of my homework, in the late evening, I give time for managing the technical work in the company, which I work for. Despite the hectic schedule, I manage to squeeze in time for brushing up my extracurricular activities everyday. Finally, I grab my dinner and around 11 pm, I collapse onto my bed to dive into the world of dreams.
